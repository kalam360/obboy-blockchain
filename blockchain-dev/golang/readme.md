# Blockchain Development in Go

## Blockchain from scratch
The project will be a commandline tools to deploy and interact with blockchain. We will develop the blockchain with Golang. Command line will use `cobra` library. 

### Code will be followed from:
- initial database setup
- Commandline tools
- to use command line additional modules

### Step 1
- Create the main function for the commandline tool usin `cobra` library


## Make your first blockchain
### Basics
- Blockchain is a database. Initial state of the database is the "Genesis" block. Every change in that database is "Transactions". In a blockchain "State" all the participants balances are stored. 
- Event Sourcing Architecture: Series of events that are recognized and finally aggregated in database. If one has the genesis block and all the transactions, he will be able to recover the current state of the blockchain.

### Builtin Functions and what they do
- make() -> Create slices or maps
- for a, b := range {} -> similar to python for i in range()
- json.Unmarshal() ->
